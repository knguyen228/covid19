# The Vocallect Project

You are invited to participate in Vocallect: a voice collection research study. Our aim is to understand and classify the impacts that communication disorders may have on speech production. 

In this brief protocol, you will: 
- Answer a series of short questions about your current communication disorder(s).
- Perform a set of voice tasks.
